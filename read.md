## Animation: Geometry, Trigonometry, Linear Algebra and Interpolation and Easing Function

## ALL Math: Discrete Math(Fundamental 2), Number theory (DS), Algebra(Fundamental 1), Liner algebra (ML), Mathematical Induction (Recursion), Basic Probability and Statistic (ML), Graph Theory(DS), Boolean Algebra, Calculus(ML and Simulation), Solving Equations(DS), Logarithms(DS), Functions solving (DS), Prime numbers, GP and AP, Geometry and Trigonometry, Exponential(DS), Modulus(DS), Factorial(DS), Recurrence Relation and Series (DS: Recursion), Matrices and Matrix operations (DS)

[[##]] Prerequisites of Integration: Algebra + discrete math + basic calculus -> Integrations

[[##]] Prerequisites of Recurrence Relation: Basic Principles of Sequence and series -> Summation and series formulas -> Inductive Reasoning and Mathematical Induction -> Number Theory -> Generating Functions -> Newton's method (for value of p)

# Q: What type of recursion and what kind of recurrence relation it has? [ An approach is selected based on these two ]

Reminder: There's no single math topic that can handle all types of recursion, depending on "recursion type" and "recurrence relations"; the different approach is required

## Recursive functions/Recurrence relations: Master Theorem (divide and conquer recursions) or Akra-Bazzi (same and versatile)

[[##]] Algorithms and complexity: it isn't a math topic but a concept i.e. Big O Notation

## MATH: Discrete Math + Linear Algebra is enough for DSA (VVIP) and optional basic probalities and statistics and basic graph and basic calculus

## upper bound: maximum time or space to be take by the algo (it won't be more than that never) or in a sorted array if given a target the first greater element than target [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] target = 2; upper bound here is 3

## lower bound: minimum time or space by algorithm and in a sorted array first less element [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] t = 3; lower = 2


## worst time complexities based on the given input's length

## leetcoding: take note of specific algo being used for specific problems and patterns
