## Discrete Math + Linear Algebra is enough for DSA

## must know upper limit of every data structures e.g. upper limit of 32-bit signed integer

## worst time complexities based on the given input's length

## leetcoding: take note of specific algo being used for specific problems and patterns

## While loop: until iterator changes I can do whatever

```java

class Looping {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int iterator = 0;
        
        while (iterator < 10) {
            // now I can do whatever and it won't go to next iteration unless iterato has been changed
        }
    }
}

```

## Any raw data could be represented in a "visual mathematical format" and it is very helpful to figure out the solution when stuck 



## new question: thinking approach

a. Take all the possible inputs and consider "possibilities / possible cases from each input"

b. can't figure an out approach, brute force. Not event Brute Force, then understand solution and if needed draw it out then code it myself ( don't just copy-paste solution)

N.B: ensure Brute force solution is a working solution even if TLE error

c. From here, optimize it 

d. done
