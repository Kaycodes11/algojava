# My approach to problem-solving:
1) PS - Input - Output 
2) identification of any pattern (pattern could be explicit or need to figure out)
3) brainstorm (break down the PS into a few steps and solve)
[P.S]: do not try to jump or think based on the given `Output` rather think about the in-between steps to reach `Output`  
4) dry run 
5) final code

# General patterns on Array:
1) HashMap
2) Modify array with helper fn
3) two pointer, sliding window
4) Math.log, (+, -, /, *) and remainder (%)


# Array problems essential guideline:

1) is it a sorted or unsorted? does it need to be sorted?
2) does it have null or negative value?
3) does it need hashMap?
4) two pointers, sliding window
5) does it need insertion/removal efficiency of O(1) at front/back? = then stack, queue or SL, DL

[NOTE]: both stack & queue implemented via LinkedList

# Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : here top/front 5 and back/bottom 1
[push add element(s) from top/front & pop remove elements from top/front]
usage: when something needs to do with exact previous value, then stack

# Queue : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : here top/front 5 and back/bottom 1
[enqueue adds element at back/bottom & deque remove element from top/front]

# What is sub-array, substring and subset?
