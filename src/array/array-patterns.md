# When solving array questions, mostly these patterns could work:

1. Two pointers

2. sliding window

3. Prefix Sum

4. Sorting (quick sort, merge sort, insertion, selection etc.)

5. Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)

6. Hashing / HashMap

7. Dynamic Programming

8. Greedy

# SOLVING FRAMEWORK:

1. need a searching - sorting algo ?

2. need another data structure ? e.g. hashmap

3. need a specific pattern or specific patterns ?

4. Brute Force
